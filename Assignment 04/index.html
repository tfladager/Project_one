    <h1>Calm Despite the Storm</h1>
    <h2>You've got this.</h2>
  <p>This morning is beautiful. The sky is the palest of blues; so pale, in fact
    that the scattered white fluffy clouds are barely distinguishable. From my desk,
    near the window, a breeze sings through the slight opening at the bottom of my window.
    A bird chirps, while another sings a differnet song.</p>
  <p>I try to focus on this instead of the mess I have on my desk with bills to
    be paid, checkbooks to balance, and to-do lists partially scratched out, piled on
    top of other to-do lists that are also partially sctatched out. Nothing will get done
    if I panic. There's no good to come from letting anxiety take hold. instead
    I breathe a deep breath, and try to just get one thing done.</p>
