    <h1>Seasons on a Cattle Ranch in NE Montana</h1>
    <p>Today, June 5, 2024, we are preparing for haying season. 
        For the next several months, we will be spending hours on the swather,
        then the rake, followed by the baler, and then picking up the 
        bales with a tractor, loading them onto a flatbed trailer, hauling
        them home, and stacking them with another trailer.</p>
        <p>When that is all done, it will be time to get things ready 
        for the snow to fall and another change of seasons. The older I get
        the faster this cycle turns.</p>
